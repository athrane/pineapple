Development documentation

	This document provides an overview of the various documents and links 
	that are part of this project's technical documentation.

* Implementation
	
	All of the implementation of the project resides in the Maven POM.
		
	The project builds a ZIP file named <<<pineapple-standalone-web-client-$\{pineapple.release.version\}.zip.>>> 
	where <<<$\{pineapple.release.version\}>>> is the current Pineapple version.
	
	The ZIP file creation is implemented in the	Maven assembly file <<<src\main\assembly\release.xml.>>>
	
	The content of the project is located in the directory <<<src\main\release-dir>>> which contains the application directory. 
		
	The ZIP file contains the structure:
	
+---+
pineapple-standalone-web-client-${pineapple.release.version}
     |     
     +--- runPineapple.cmd
     +--- runPineapple.sh     
     |     
     +--- conf     
     |     +--- log4j.properties
     |     `--- jetty.xml
     |               
     +--- resources
     |     `--- jetty-logging.properties
     |               
     +--- webapps
     |     `--- pineapple-web-application-war.war
     |               
     +--- lib
           +--- pineapple-jetty-starter-1.0.jar
           +--- jetty-*.jar
           +--- log4j-1.2.14.jar
           +--- slf4j-api-1.7.7.jar           
           +--- slf4j-log4j12-1.7.7.jar           
+---+	 	 
	
	The <<<runPineapple.cmd>>> or <<<runPineapple.sh>>> invokes Java with the Jetty starter JAR file 
	<<<pineapple-jetty-starter-X.0.jar>>> which starts Jetty as a stand-alone application.
	
	When Jetty starts, it will deploy the Pineapple <<<pineapple-web-application-war.war>>>
	and thus make it available as a stand-alone application.
	
	The <<<conf>>> directory contains internal configuration files.
	
	The <<<webapps>>> directory contains the Pineapple web application (war) which are deployed into Jetty.
	
	The <<<lib>>> directory contains all the jar files that constitutes the Jetty web server.
			
* Internal configuration

	The stand-alone web application uses two configuration files. The source files are 
	located in the directory <<<src\main\release-dir\conf>>>. As a result of the
	build process the configuration files are copied into the ZIP file in the 
	location <<<pineapple-standalone-web-client-$\{version\}\conf>>> as shown above.
	
	The files are: 
	
	* <<<log4j.properties>>> - configures logging.
	
	* <<<jetty.xml>>> - configures the Jetty web server.

	[]
	
**	Logging 
	
	Jetty is configured to use Slf4j and Log4j for logging. 
	
	Slf4j is enabled in the file
	<<<pineapple-standalone-web-client-$\{pineapple.release.version}/resources/jetty-logging.properties>>> 
	file which configures Jetty logging layer by setting the value of the <<<org.eclipse.jetty.util.log.class>>>: 

+---
# Configure Jetty for SLf4j Logging
org.eclipse.jetty.util.log.class=org.eclipse.jetty.util.log.Slf4jLog
+---

	Log4j is "enabled" through the inclusion of the Slf4j binding layer for Log4j in the application
	class path, e.g. the jars <<<slf4j-api-VERSION.jar>>> and <<<slf4j-log4j12-VERSION.jar>>>           
	
	The log output is controlled by the Log4j configuration file
	<<<pineapple-standalone-web-client-$\{pineapple.release.version}/conf/log4j.properties>>>.	
	The <<<log4j.properties>>> file. configures logging for ALL the Pineapple 
	components / jars which constitutes the web application. Log4j is configured to
	log to <<<$\{pineapple.home.dir}/logs/pineapple-web-application.log>>>. 		
		
**	Jetty server web configuration

	The Jetty web server is configured by the <<<jetty.xml>>> file  which defines:
	
	* The thread pool
	
	* The connectors and handlers
		
	[]
				
* Application version

	The master POM for the Pineapple project contains a property definition named <<<pineapple.release.version>>> 
	which contains the current visual release number:
		
+---+
	<properties>
		<pineapple.release.version>x.y.z</pineapple.release.version>
	</properties>

+---+	 

	The version number is added to name of the created ZIP file during usage of the assemply file.

	For more information about Pineapple version information please consult the
	{{{../../../../development/version-info.html}version info page}}.


** Substituting the release version into the starter scripts

	The <<<runPineapple.cmd>>> or <<<runPineapple.sh>>> invokes Java with the Jetty starter JAR file 
	<<<pineapple-jetty-starter-X.0.jar>>> which starts Jetty as a stand-alone application.

	TODO.
