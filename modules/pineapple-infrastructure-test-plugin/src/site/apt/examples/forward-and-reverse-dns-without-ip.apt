How-to: Test forward and reverse DNS resolution of an host name without an explicit IP address

* Overview
 		
	This example extends the example {{{./forward-and-reverse-dns.html}How-to: Test forward and reverse DNS resolution of an host name}} 
	by doing resolution without specifying an target IP address.	
						
* Specifying the test case without an IP address	

	Open the model file for the target environment and write the test case where the <<<ip>>> attribute has the value "":

      <itp:infrastructure>                                                                                                      
        
        <itp:dns-resolution-test host="garuda" ip="" description="host garuda resolves to IP ??! and back" />
                                                        
      </itp:infrastructure>                                                                     
    </mmd:content>
  </mmd:model>
</mmd:models>

	When the test case is execute then host name is attempted to be resolved to an IP address. Instead of 
	verifying the resolved IP address against the value of the <<<ip>>> attribute, the test case is content that
	the resolution didn't fail. 
	
	The resolved IP address is used as input in the second part of the test case where it it used to do a reverse DNS 
	lookup to the host name.
