How-to: Write HTTP test case which tests for HTTP status code 200


* Overview
 	
	Two steps are needed to configure the plugin to work:
	
	* Define <<resource>> which defines access to the plugin.   	 	 
	 	
	* Add test cases to the Pineapple <<module>>.
	
	[] 
	
** A prefabricated example in the default configuration

	Pineapple includes a prefabricated version of this example in the default configuration. The example is named	
	<<infrastructure-test-004-pineapple-web-client-returns-http-200>>. The default configuration is created by starting 
	Pineapple. The default configuration will also create the required resource in the <<local>> environment 
	which is used to execute the test operation on the model. 

* Testing that a host returns a HTTP status code 200

	To test that the host which accessed by the URL: <<<http://localhost:8080>>>,
	returns the HTTP status code 200:
	
	Open the model file for the target environment and add the test case:

+--------
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<mmd:models xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xmlns:mmd="http://pineapple.dev.java.net/ns/module_model_1_0" 		
  xmlns:ifp="http://pineapple.dev.java.net/ns/plugin/infrastructure_1_0" >
  <mmd:model target-resource="infrastructure-test">
    <mmd:content>
      <itp:infrastructure><

        <itp:http-statuscode-test          
          description="Pineapple client on localhost:8080" 
          url="http://localhost:8080" 
          expected="200" />

      </itp:infrastructure>
    </mmd:content>
  </mmd:model>
</mmd:models>
+--------		
	
** Meaning of the elements in the test 

	* The <<<http-statuscode-test>>> element defines the skeleton of the test case.
	
	* The <<<description>>> attribute should contain a suitable description of the test which 
	is used by Pineapple at run time in clients and reports to show the outcome of the test.	  

	* The <<<url>>> attribute defines the URL which is accessed by ythe test. In 
	this case it is the <<<http://localhost:8080>>>. 

	* The <<<expected>>> attribute defines the expected HTTP status code which is asserted. 

	[]
	
* Accessing the target host through a proxy 

	If the target host should be accessed through a proxy server then a proxy 
	definition must be added to the model file and the test case must reference 
	the proxy definition.
	
	For information about how to define and use proxy's in test cases, refer to the 
	{{{../usage/index.html}plugin usage page.}} Or look at
	{{{./use-proxy.html}the proxy example.}}  
	
* Run the test

	[[1]] Start Pineapple.
	
	[[2]] Select the module <<infrastructure-test-004-pineapple-web-client-returns-http-200>> which where created above.
	
	[[3]] Select the model named <<local>>.
	
	[[4]] Execute the <<test>> operation by selecting the menu <<Execute>> | <<Test>> | <<Run Test>>.
