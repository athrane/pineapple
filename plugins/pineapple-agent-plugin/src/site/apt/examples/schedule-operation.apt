How-to: Schedule an operation at an agent

* Overview

	This example illustrates how the agent plugin can be used to schedule the execution of an operation 
	at a remote Pineapple agent. 

* Define the module 

	Pineapple's unit of work is modules. A module is a self contained unit which 
	can contain models, scripts and binaries. Models serves to specify test cases, 
	deployment of applications, configuration of devices or execution of scripts. 
	
	The default directory for modules is <<<$\{user.home\}/.pineapple/modules>>> so we will 
	create a module named <<<agent-schedule-module>>> there. The module 
	for this example will end up with the structure:

+---
agent-schedule-module
 |
 +--- models	 
       +--- local.xml 
+---
	
* Define the module model

	The model file for the scheduled execution of the module <<<infrastructure-test-004-pineapple-web-client-returns-http-200>>>:
	
+----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<mmd:models xmlns:mmd="http://pineapple.dev.java.net/ns/module_model_1_0" 	
    xmlns:pap="http://pineapple.dev.java.net/ns/plugin/agent_1_0" >
    <mmd:model target-resource="agent-node1">
        <mmd:content>
            <pap:agent>
               <pap:schedule-operation name="myjob" module="infrastructure-test-004-pineapple-web-client-returns-http-200" environment="local" operation="test" scheduling-expression="0 * * * * *" description="Test Pineapple is running, executed hourly."/>
            </pap:agent>			
        </mmd:content>
    </mmd:model>
</mmd:models>
+----	 

** The configuration details

	Two schema are used in the model file. The <<<http://pineapple.dev.java.net/ns/module_model_1_0>>> is used
	to define the namespace <<<mmd>>> which defines the general infrastructure for models. 
	The <<<http://pineapple.dev.java.net/ns/plugin/agent_1_0>>> schema is used to 
	define the namespace <<<pap>>> which is used to define the model for the agent plugin. 
	Since multiple schemas are used to define the model file, the elements are qualified.
	
	The <<<target-resource>>> attribute defines a reference to the resource which is targeted when the 
	model executed. In this case, the value <<<agent-node1>>> is a reference to a resource which defines a Pineapple agent.
	
	The <<<pap:agent>>> element defines the root of model for the agent plugin. The 
	<<<pap:schedule-operation>>> element defines command to execute the module at 
	the remote Pineapple agent:

	* The <<<name>>> attribute defines the name of scheduling job. Must be unique.
	
	* The <<<module>>> attribute defines the name of the module at the agent scheduled for execution.

	* The <<<environment>>> attribute defines the name of the target environment, e.g. the model which is used 
	for the operation. 	
		
	* The <<<operation>>> attribute defines the operation which is invoked periodically.

	* The <<<scheduling-expression>>> attribute defines the scheduling expression using Cron syntax to defined the frequency of the module execution.

	* The <<<description>>> attribute defines the a human readable discription of the scheduled operation.

* Invoke Pineapple to execute model 

	Start your Pineapple client of choice:
	
	* Select the module named <<agent-schedule-module>>
	
	* Select the <<local>> model.
	
	* Invoke any operation to execute the operation at the agent.
