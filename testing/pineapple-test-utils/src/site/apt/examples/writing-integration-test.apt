How-to: Write integration tests in Pineapple

* Definition 

	In the context of the Pineapple project, an integration test is an isolated test of a single class or a set of classes.
	Dependencies to other classes are satisfied using real classes.
	Dependencies are managed using dependency injection using Spring.	
	Mocking is used some exceptions to mock special dependencies. 

An integration test is a test of single class, where dependencies are satisfied using real classes.


* How to write integration tests 

	To write integration test do:
		
	* Add Maven dependencies to the project
	
	* Write tests.	
	
	* Inspect log files.
	
	[]		  
		 
* Add Maven dependencies to the project	
	  	
** Add Spring-test dependency

	The Spring-test jar gives access to:
	
	* The <<<@RunWith>>> annotation.
	
	* The <<<@ContextConfiguration>>> annotation.
	
	[]	
	 	
	To use the Spring framework test facilities, add the Maven dependency to 
	the project POM:

+-----
  <dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework</groupId>
    <artifactId>org.springframework.test</artifactId>
    <scope>test</scope>		
  </dependency>					
+-----

	Version information is located in the <<<pineapple-project/pom.xml>>>. The dependency
	is scoped as <<<test>>> as it should only be available in the test phase.

** Add JSR-250 annotations 	 	

	The JSR-250 annotations gives access to:
	
	* The <<<@Resource>>> annotation which is used to field injection in Spring.	

	[]
	
	Add the Maven dependency to the project POM:

+-----
  <dependency>
    <groupId>javax.annotation</groupId>
    <artifactId>jsr250-api</artifactId>
	<scope>test</scope>    
  </dependency> 	
+-----

	Version information is located in the <<<pineapple-project/pom.xml>>>. The dependency
	is scoped as <<<test>>> as it should only be avaiable in the test pahse.		 	
	 	
** Example: pineapple-infrastructure-test-plugin dependencies

** Locate the classes in test source folder
		
	The integration test cases are placed in the <<<src/test/java>>> folder. 
	
	Integration tests are located in same folders as the unit tests. The tests 
	are separated by the used naming convention, as shown in the next section.		
	
** Postfix the class names with <<<IntegrationTest>>>
	
	Test classes are named <<<XxxIntegrationTest>>> where <<<Xxx>>> is the 
	name of the class which is integration tested. 
	
	Example: The integration test class for the class <<<TestDeployedConfiguration>>> 
	should be named <<<TestDeployedConfigurationIntegrationTest>>>.

** Annotate the class as an integration test

	The test class should annotated with t

	
** Configure the class to be run with the Spring JUnit class runner

	Annotate the class with the <<<@RunWith( SpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class )>>> 
	Spring annotation to configure the class to be run with the Spring JUnit class 
	runner.
	
	Example: The integration class <<<TestDeployedConfigurationIntegrationTest>>> in 
	the <<<pineapple-weblogic-jmx-plugin-integration-test>>> project is configured with:	
	
	* <<<@RunWith( SpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class )>>> to configure class to be run with Spring Junit test runner.

** Configure the class to be run with the proper context configuration	
	
	Annotate the class with the <<<@ContextConfiguration( locations = { "/some-app-config-config.xml" } )>>> 
	Spring annotation to configure the Spring JUnit class runner to load the 
	application context from the designated location(s). 	

	Example: The integration class <<<TestDeployedConfigurationIntegrationTest>>> in 
	the <<<pineapple-helloworld-plugin-integration-test>>> project could be configured with:	
	
	* <<<@ContextConfiguration( locations = { "/com.alpha.pineapple.plugin.helloworld-config.xml" } )>>>
	to load the application context from the <<<src/main/resources directory>>> from the 
	<<<pineapple-helloword-plugin>>> project. <<Please notice:>> The integration test uses the Spring 
	application context file which is used to configure the project. 
		
+-----		
package com.alpha.pineapple.plugin.helloworld.operation;

import ...;

/**
 * Integration test for the <code>TestDeployedConfiguration</code> class.  
 */
@RunWith( SpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class )
@ContextConfiguration( locations = { "/com.alpha.pineapple.plugin.helloworld-config.xml" } )
public class TestDeployedConfigurationIntegrationTest
{
	// class content goes here... 
}		
+-----			
	
** Use annotation based dependency injection to get the class under test

	An instance of the class under test, should be obtained by using the annotation based
	dependency injection mechanism in Spring. To enable it: 
	
	* Define a field in the integration test class with the object under test and annotate 
	it with the <<<@Resource>>> annotation. 
	
	* Define a bean in the application context file, with an id matching the field name.
	
	[]
	
	When the tests is run Spring will initialize the field with the bean defined in the 
	application context file.
	
	Example: The integration class <<<TestDeployedConfigurationIntegrationTest>>> in 
	the <<<pineapple-helloworld-plugin>>> project, could be implemented 
	with the field <<<TestDeployedConfiguration operation;>>> which is annotated with
	the <<<@Resource>>> annotation:
	
+-----		
package com.alpha.pineapple.plugin.helloworld.operation;

import ...;

/**
 * Integration test for the <code>TestDeployedConfiguration</code> class.  
 */
@RunWith( SpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class )
@ContextConfiguration( locations = { "/com.alpha.pineapple.plugin.helloworld-config.xml" } )
public class TestDeployedConfigurationIntegrationTest
{
    /**
     * Object under test.
     */
    @Resource
    TestDeployedConfiguration testDeployedConfiguration;
	
	// remaining class content goes here...
}		
+-----			


** Add Spring environment profile to support injection of the class under test

	In order to enable Spring to inject the class under test (as described in the previous paragraph) it is required 
	to add the class to Spring context configuration.

	Some classes are added to the context in order for them to be injected, e.g. command classes and the message provider.
	But other classes are discovered by the class scanning as part of the plugin framework initialized of plugins, e.g. operation classes.
	The bean is defined in the application context file for the <<<pineapple-helloworld-plugin>>> project:

+-----			   
    <bean id="testDeployedConfiguration" class="com.alpha.pineapple.plugin.helloworld.operation.TestDeployedConfiguration" />
+-----			   
	 	
** Define mock plugin providers

	There are two approaches to define mock objects for plugin providers in integration tests:
	
	* Define mock providers in the Spring application context
	
	* Use mock providers from the test-utils project
	
	[]

*** Define mock providers in the Spring application context

	If an integration test requires usage of plugin providers, then a mock provider can be defined 
	in the Spring application context using the Spring feature classed environment profile.
	
	An environment profile allows for the definition of beans which are only accessible when the test
	is executed with the profile defined as being active.
	
	To enable it: 	
	
	* Define an environment profile named <integration-test>.
	
	* Define mock providers and other test classes to be injected into test classes 
	in the application context within the profile section:

+-----			   
    <!-- 
        definitions used by the integration tests. 
        Only available for test with @ActiveProfiles("integration-test") 
    -->
    <beans profile="integration-test" >
        <bean id="defaultOperation" class="com.alpha.pineapple.plugin.agent.operation.DefaultOperation" />		
        <bean id="coreAdministrationProvider" class="org.easymock.EasyMock" factory-method="createMock" primary="true" >
            <constructor-arg value="com.alpha.pineapple.admin.AdministrationProvider"/>
        </bean>
        <bean id="coreExecutionInfoProvider" class="org.easymock.EasyMock" factory-method="createMock">
            <constructor-arg value="com.alpha.pineapple.execution.ExecutionInfoProvider"/>
        </bean>
        <bean id="coreRuntimeDirectoryProvider" class="org.easymock.EasyMock" factory-method="createMock">
            <constructor-arg value="com.alpha.pineapple.io.file.RuntimeDirectoryProvider"/>
        </bean>					    	    	
    </beans>
+-----			   

	* A test class that need access to the mock providers (or other test classes to be injected) must be annotated with
	the <<<@ActiveProfiles("integration-test")>>>:

+-----			   
@ActiveProfiles("integration-test")
@RunWith(SpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class)
@TestExecutionListeners({ DirectoryTestExecutionListener.class, DependencyInjectionTestExecutionListener.class })
@ContextConfiguration(locations = { PLUGIN_APP_CONTEXT })
public class CloneRepositoryCommandSystemTest {
+-----			   

 	[]

*** Use the test context configuration to test classes which uses plugin providers

	The plugin framework defines two plugin providers which can provide a plugin with 
	useful information at runtime:
	
	* An operation can gain access to a <<<ExecutionInfo>>> object which contains 
	runtime information about the operation
	
	* An operation can gain access to a <<<RuntimeDirectoryProvider>>> object 
	which contains runtime information about which runtime directories Pineapple is using.
	
	[]
	
	The providers are injected into the plugin application context as beans when Pineapple 
	is initialized. During integration test of classes in an plugin project which uses these 
	providers, the provider beans must be present in the plugin application context or the 
	test will fail due to dependency injection errors.
	
	The solution is to use the <test context configuration> named 
	<<<com.alpha.pineapple.testutils-config.xml>>> which is defined in the the 
	<<<pineapple-test-utils>>> project.	     	   				

	The test context configuration contains bean definitions of the plugin provider whose 
	implementations are uninitialized <EasyMock> objects:

+---

<!-- definition of MOCK runtime directory provider -->
<bean id="runtimeDirectoryProvider" class="org.easymock.EasyMock" factory-method="createMock">
	<constructor-arg value="com.alpha.pineapple.io.file.RuntimeDirectoryProvider"/>
</bean>

<!-- definition of MOCK execution info provider -->
<bean id="executionInfoProvider" class="org.easymock.EasyMock" factory-method="createMock">
	<constructor-arg value="com.alpha.pineapple.execution.ExecutionInfoProvider"/>
</bean>
+---
	
	To use <test context configuration> follow these steps:
	
	[[1]] Add a Maven dependency to the <<<pineapple-test-utils>>> project.
	
	[[2]] Add the <<<com.alpha.pineapple.testutils-config.xml>>> to the <<<@ContextConfiguration>>>
	annotation for the integration test case which required the presence of the provider 
	classes. Example:

+-----		
package com.alpha.pineapple.plugin.helloworld.operation;

import ...;

/**
 * Integration test for the <code>TestDeployedConfiguration</code> class.  
 */
@RunWith( SpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class )
@ContextConfiguration( locations = { "/com.alpha.pineapple.testutils-config.xml", "/com.alpha.pineapple.plugin.helloworld-config.xml" } )
public class TestDeployedConfigurationIntegrationTest
{
	// class content goes here... 
}		
+-----			

	[[3]] Add a field in the test class to inject the provider to able to initialize it. Example:
	
+-----		
public class TestDeployedConfigurationIntegrationTest
{

    /**
     * Mock Runtime directory provider.
     */
    @Resource
    RuntimeDirectoryProvider coreRuntimeDirectoryProvider;
 
}		
+-----			
		
	[[4]] Initialize the mock providers. The mock providers are now defined and injected into the 
	classes in the plugin application context. But as mocks they are not initialized. They will not 
	return any values when invoked. To complete the initialization add a field to the integration 
	test to get the mock injected into the integration test class and then complete initialization 
	of the mock provider in the <<<setup()>>> method and/or individual test methods. <<<Please 
	notice:>>> the providers should reset between each test method by invoking:
	
+-----
@Before
public void setUp() throws Exception {

	// reset plugin provider
	EasyMock.reset(coreRuntimeDirectoryProvider);
	
	// more stuff here        
}	
+-----

* Inspect log files

	If the projects doesn't define any <<<log4j.properties>> in 
	<<<src/java/resources/log4.properties>>> then the <<<pineapple-test-utils>>> project
	contains a log4j configuration file defined in the directory 
	<<<src/java/resources/log4.properties>>> for use by dependent projects as 
	part of their test configuration. 
	
	The test configuration configures Log4j to write log files 
	to <<<$\{user.home}/.pineapple/logs/pineapple-.log>>>.
