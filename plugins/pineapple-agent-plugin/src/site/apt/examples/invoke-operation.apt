How-to: Invoke operation at an agent

* Overview

	This example illustrates how the agent plugin can be used to execute an operation 
	at a remote Pineapple agent. 

* Define the module 

	Pineapple's unit of work is modules. A module is a self contained unit which 
	can contain models, scripts and binaries. Models serves to specify test cases, 
	deployment of applications, configuration of devices or execution of scripts. 
	
	The default directory for modules is <<<$\{user.home\}/.pineapple/modules>>> so we will 
	create a module named <<<agent-execute-module>>> there. The module 
	for this example will end up with the structure:

+---
agent-execute-module
 |
 +--- models	 
       +--- local.xml 
+---
	
* Define the module model

	The model file for execution of the module <<<planet-violet-001>>>:
	
+----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<mmd:models xmlns:mmd="http://pineapple.dev.java.net/ns/module_model_1_0" 	
    xmlns:pap="http://pineapple.dev.java.net/ns/plugin/agent_1_0" >
    <mmd:model target-resource="agent-node1">
        <mmd:content>
            <pap:agent>
                <pap:execute-operation module="planet-violet-001" operation"deploy-configuration" environment="linux-vagrant" />
            </pap:agent>			
        </mmd:content>
    </mmd:model>
</mmd:models>
+----	 

** The configuration details

	Two schema are used in the model file. The <<<http://pineapple.dev.java.net/ns/module_model_1_0>>> is used
	to define the namespace <<<mmd>>> which defines the general infrastructure for models. 
	The <<<http://pineapple.dev.java.net/ns/plugin/agent_1_0>>> schema is used to 
	define the namespace <<<pap>>> which is used to define the model for the agent plugin. 
	Since multiple schemas are used to define the model file, the elements are qualified.
	
	The <<<target-resource>>> attribute defines a reference to the resource which is targeted when the 
	model executed. In this case, the value <<<agent-node1>>> is a reference to a resource which defines a Pineapple agent.
	
	The <<<pap:agent>>> element defines the root of model for the agent plugin. The 
	<<<pap:execute-operation>>> element defines command to execute the module at 
	the remote Pineapple agent:
	
	* <<<module>>> defines the name of the module, which must already be present at the agent.

	* <<<environment>>> defines the name of the target environment, e.g. the model which is used 
	for the operation. 	
		
	* <<<operation>>> defines the name of the operation to invoke.	
		
	[]  
		 
* Invoke Pineapple to execute model 

	Start your Pineapple client of choice:
	
	* Select the module named <<agent-execute-module>>
	
	* Select the <<local>> model.
	
	* Invoke any operation to execute the operation at the agent.
