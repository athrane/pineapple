How-to: Test reverse DNS resolution of an IP address

* Overview
 	
	Two steps are needed to configure the plugin to work:
	
	* Define <<resource>> which defines access to the plugin. 
	
	* Define test cases in Pineapple module.
	
	[]
			
** A prefabricated example in the default configuration

	Pineapple includes a prefabricated version of this example in the default configuration. The example is named	
	<<infrastructure-test-002-reverse-dns-resolution-localhost>>. The default configuration is created by starting 
	Pineapple. The default configuration will also create the required resource in the <<local>> environment 
	which is used to execute the test operation on the model. 
	
* Add reverse DNS resolution test cases to Pineapple module	

	Open the model file for the target environment and add the test case:
				
+---
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<mmd:models xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xmlns:mmd="http://pineapple.dev.java.net/ns/module_model_1_0"                 
  xmlns:ifp="http://pineapple.dev.java.net/ns/plugin/infrastructure_1_0" >
  <mmd:model target-resource="infrastructure-test">             
    <mmd:content>                               
      <itp:infrastructure>                                                                                                      
        
        <itp:dns-reverse-resolution-test host="garuda" ip="10.20.30.1" description="10.20.30.1 resolves to garuda" />
                                                        
      </itp:infrastructure>                                                                     
    </mmd:content>
  </mmd:model>
</mmd:models>

** Meaning of the elements in the test 

	* The <<<dns-reverse-resolution-test>>> element defines the skeleton of the test case.
	
	* The <<<description>>> attribute should contain a suitable description of the test which 
	is used by Pineapple at run time in clients and reports to show the outcome of the test.	  

	* The <<<host>>> attribute defines the expected host name that 
	the IP address should be resolved to. 

	* The <<<ip >>> attribute defines the IP address which should be resolved 
	to an host name. 

	[]

* Run the test

	[[1]] Start Pineapple.
	
	[[2]] Select the module <<infrastructure-test-002-reverse-dns-resolution-localhost>> which where created above.
	
	[[3]] Select the model named <<local>>.
	
	[[4]] Execute the <<test>> operation by selecting the menu <<Execute>> | <<Test>> | <<Run Test>>.
