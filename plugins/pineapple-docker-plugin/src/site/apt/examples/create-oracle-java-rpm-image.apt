How-to: Create Oracle JDK Docker image

* Overview

	This example illustrates how the Docker plugin can be used to 
	create a Docker image based on CentOS 7.6 with Oracle JDK (Java Development Kit) 7 or 8 installed.

** Part of the default configuration

	This example named <<<docker-004-java8-oraclejdk-rpm-image-centos>>>, including all configuration files, 
	is included in the {{{../../../usage/default-configuration.html}default configuration}} which is created by Pineapple, 
	so there is no need to create it by hand.	
	A corresponding example for Java 7, named <<<docker-004-java7-oraclejdk-rpm-image-centos>>>, is also included in the 
	default configuration.
	
* Define the module 

	Pineapple's unit of work is modules. A module is a self contained unit which 
	can contain models, scripts and binaries. Models serves to specify test cases, 
	deployment of applications, configuration of devices or execution of scripts. 
	
	The default directory for modules is <<<$\{user.home\}/.pineapple/modules>>> so we will 
	create a module named <<<docker-004-java8-oraclejdk-rpm-image-centos>>> there. 
	The module for this example will end up with the structure:

+---
docker-004-java8-oraclejdk-rpm-image-centos
 |
 +--- models	 
 |     +--- linux-vagrant.xml 
 +--- dockersrc	 
       +--- Dockerfile
       +----jdk-8u40-linux-x64.rpm       
+---
	
* Define the module model

	The model file for definition of the image:
	
+----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<mmd:models xmlns:mmd="http://pineapple.dev.java.net/ns/module_model_1_0"       
    xmlns:dkp="http://pineapple.dev.java.net/ns/plugin/docker_1_0" >
    <mmd:model target-resource="docker-node" description="Define tagged Docker image: pineapple/centos-oracle-java:8 from Dockerfile" >
        <mmd:content>
            <dkp:docker>
              <dkp:image-from-dockerfile source-directory="modulepath:dockersrc" pull-image="false" >
                <dkp:target-image repository="pineapple/centos-oracle-java" tag="8" />
              </dkp:image-from-dockerfile>
            </dkp:docker>                       
        </mmd:content>
    </mmd:model>
</mmd:models>
+----	 

** The configuration details

	Two schema are used in the model file. The <<<http://pineapple.dev.java.net/ns/module_model_1_0>>> is used
	to define the namespace <<<mmd>>> which defines the general infrastructure for models. 
	The <<<http://pineapple.dev.java.net/ns/plugin/docker_1_0>>> schema is used to
	define the namespace <<<dkp>>> which is used to define the model for the Docker plugin. 
	Since multiple schemas are used to define the model file, the elements are qualified.
	
	The <<<target-resource>>> attribute defines a reference to the resource which is targeted when the 
	model executed. In this case, the value <<<docker-node>>> is a reference to a resource which defines a Docker daemon.
	
	The <<<dkp:docker>>> element defines the root of model for the Docker plugin. 
		
	The <<<dkp:image-from-dockerfile>>> element defines a tagged Docker image which can be used for creation or deletion 
	depending on the invoked operation.
	
	When the model is invoked with the <deploy-configuration> operation, then target image is created from the source image. 
	The source image is defined by the DockerFile (see detail below).
				
	When the image is created then source directory, defined by the <<<source-directory>>> attribute on element <<<dkp:image-from-dockerfile>>>,
	is compressed into a TAR archive and uploaded to Docker. 
	Please notice that source directory is defined using the variable <modulepath:dockersrc> which is resolved at runtime to the
	directory <dockersrc> within the module.
	
	Docker unpacks the archive and looks for a Dockerfile in the root of the archive. 
	The Dockerfile along with other file material in the archive is used to create the image.	
		 		 
	The name of the target image is defined by the <<<dkp:target-image>>> element.		

** Dockerfile

	The Dockerfile contains:
	
+----	 
# Pull base image
# ---------------
FROM centos:latest

# Maintainer
# ----------
MAINTAINER Allan Thrane Andersen <einheriii@gmail.com>

# Define variable
ENV JAVA_ARCHIVE jdk-8u40-linux-x64.rpm

# Stage pineapple binary 
COPY $JAVA_ARCHIVE /tmp/

# install java
WORKDIR /tmp
RUN chmod a+x $JAVA_ARCHIVE
RUN yum --assumeyes install $JAVA_ARCHIVE
RUN rm -rf $/tmp/JAVA_ARCHIVE
+----	 

	The FROM command specifies that the image <<<centos:latest>>> should be pulled from DockerHub.		 		 

	The MAINTAINER command declares the proud author.
	
	The ENV command declares the name of Java archive which is installed in the image.
	
	THE COPY command copies the Java archive from the uploaded TAR archive into 
	the <<</tmp>>> directory on image.
	
	The WORKDIR command defines the image <<</tmp>>> directory as the current directory.
	
	The first RUN command ensures that the Java archive is executable.
	
	The second RUN command installs the Java archive into the image.
	
	The last RUN command deletes the Java archive from the image <<</tmp>>> directory.

* Add binary

	The Oracle Java 8 binary <<jdk-8u40-linux-x64.rpm>> must be downloaded and added to
	the <<<dockersrc>>> directory within the module.
		 		 
* Invoke Pineapple to execute model 

	Start your Pineapple:
	
	* Select the module named <<docker-004-java8-oraclejdk-rpm-image-centos>>
	
	* Select the <<linux-vagrant>> model.
	
	* Invoke the <<deploy-configuration>> to create the tagged Docker Image named 
	<<<pineapple/centos-oracle-java:8>>> from <<<centos:latest>>> defined in the Dockerfile.
